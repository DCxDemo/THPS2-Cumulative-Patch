This is a list of known source filenames through the debug assert leftovers.
Partially code is written in pure C, but there are some classes used.

# Observed Neversoft naming conventions:
* classes start with C (CBit, CCar, CBody, CCamera)
* structs start with S (SPart, SGroup)
* enums start with E (E)
* globals may start with G (GLEVEL, gSmthEnabled)
* pointers start with p (pData, pPSX)
