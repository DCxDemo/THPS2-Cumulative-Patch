This is a list of known source filenames through the debug assert leftovers.
Partially code is written in pure C, but there are some classes used.

# Observed Neversoft naming conventions:
* classes start with C (CBit, CCar, CBody, CCamera)
* structs start with S (SPart, SGroup)
* enums start with E (E)
* globals may start with G (GLEVEL, gSmthEnabled)
* pointers start with p (pData, pPSX)

platform.cpp - assumed to be CPlatform class 
player_ui.cpp
playsel.cpp
player_spool.cpp
post.cpp
powerup.cpp - CPowerUp class, probably traces back to apocalypse as well, used for stuff like heath pickups. in THPS transformed in bonus points and cash pickups, skate letters and tapes.
PRE.cpp - PRE file management, PRE files store packed content of the specific menu screen. probably used to speedup menus loading on psx (which was rather long)
rail.cpp - handles rail logic (stick to rail, orient to rail, etc)
redbook.cpp - handles PSX CDXA audio, atrociously mapped to bik files on PC, keeping the redundant PSX specific parameters
reloc.cpp - handles "relocatable modules" or psx overlays. not used in the port.
screentools.cpp
sfx.cpp - SOUNDLIB wrapper, higher level sound functions
Shatter.cpp - shatters object in pieces, most notably used for glass

spool.cpp - data spooling system. loads data to ram from the disk
Spooler.cpp
statwin.cpp - probably some widget on statedit screen
statedit.cpp - stat editor screen (possibly psx?)
tag.cpp - probably related to graffiti mode
tapes.cpp - could be th1 leftover to show tapes at the end screen, or could be some secret tape logic?
texteffects.cpp - various font effects, most notably signature bloody falling text
textwin.cpp
trickdb.cpp - manages trick database loaded from tricks.bin file
trickob.cpp - "trickable objects", refers to any static object in the level i suppose

trickwin.cpp - some widget on tricksel screen
tricktips.cpp - handles the tips on the left side of the screen in the career mode
trig.cpp - handles the trg file (nodearray in later games)
TrigGen.cpp
video.cpp - rather misleading name, it handles the replays and highlights mode at the end of the run. they probably meant like "skate video"
vidmenu.cpp - probably video options menu
CDPlayer.cpp
d3dfunc.cpp - all d3d stuff is probably for directdraw backend port
d3dpoly.cpp
d3dsprite.cpp
d3dtex.cpp
D3dTimer.cpp - new game timer, on top of the old one
DxPlay.cpp - low level netplay logic, wraps DirectPlay
NetGame.cpp - high level netplay logic
PcInput.cpp - input system, wraps directinput via lower level classes SDXEffect, SDXMouse, SDXKeyboard, SDXJoystick
